## Description

Barta is an Android app designed to provide users with up-to-date news from popular Bangladeshi newspapers. The news content is collected by Python web scraping scripts running on a server, which serve the data via a REST API. The app uses Retrofit to consume this API and display the news in a clean, user-friendly interface.

The app architecture follows MVVM principles, separating UI, data, and business logic to make the app modular, testable, and scalable.
